## Authentication

Currently, the API does not require authentication. All endpoints are publicly accessible.

**Future Enhancement:** JWT-based authentication is planned for production deployments.

---

## Request/Response Format

### Content Type

All API requests and responses use JSON format:

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Standard Response Format

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  // Resource-specific data
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "descriptive error message"
}
```

---

## HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Description | Usage |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| 200 OK | Request successful | GET requests, DELETE confirmations |
| 201 Created | Resource created | POST requests for new resources |
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid request data | Validation errors, malformed JSON |
| 404 Not Found | Resource not found | Invalid IDs, deleted resources |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Server error | Database errors, unexpected failures |

---

## Common Patterns

### Pagination

Currently, the API does not implement pagination. All list endpoints return complete result sets.

**Future Enhancement:** Pagination will be added for large datasets:
```
GET /api/orders?page=1&limit=20
```

### Filtering

Some endpoints support query parameter filtering:

**Food Items by Type:**
```
GET /api/v1/foods?type=Food
GET /api/v1/foods?type=Drink
GET /api/v1/foods?type=Dessert
```

**Cook Bots with Deleted:**
```
GET /api/cooks?include_deleted=true
```

### Soft Deletion

The system uses soft deletion for all resources:

- Resources are marked with `deleted_at` timestamp
- Deleted resources are excluded from default queries
- Some endpoints support `include_deleted` parameter
- Deleted resources can be reinstated (cook bots)

---

## System Behavior

### Priority Queue System

**VIP Priority:**
- VIP customer orders are always processed before Regular customer orders
- Within each priority level (VIP/Regular), FIFO ordering is maintained
- Queue operations are O(1) for optimal performance

**Order Status Flow:**
```
PENDING → SERVING → COMPLETE
```

**Cook Removal Behavior:**
- When a cook is removed, their current order (if any) returns to the **front** of the priority queue
- This ensures fairness to customers affected by cook removal

### Order Processing

**Default Processing Time:** 10 seconds (configurable via `ORDER_SERVING_DURATION` environment variable)

**Workflow:**
1. Customer creates order → Status: PENDING
2. Cook accepts order → Status: SERVING
3. Order processing completes (10s) → Status: COMPLETE

---

## Rate Limiting

Currently, the API does not implement rate limiting.

**Future Enhancement:** Rate limiting will be added for production:
- 100 requests per minute per IP
- 1000 requests per hour per IP

---

## CORS

The API currently allows all origins (CORS enabled).

**Configuration:**
```go
router.Use(cors.Default())
```

**Production:** Configure specific allowed origins for security.

## Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation

**Interactive API Documentation:**
- URL: `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html`
- Automatically enabled in non-production environments
- Disable in production by setting `ENV=production`

**Regenerate Swagger Docs:**
```bash
swag init -g cmd/api/main.go -o docs
```

## Example Usage

### Quick Start Workflow

```bash
# 1. Check API health
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# 2. Create a cook bot
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/cooks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Cook Bot 1"}'

# 3. View available food items
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/foods

# 4. Create an order
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customer_id": 1, "food_ids": [1, 2, 3]}'

# 5. Cook accepts order
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/cooks/5/accept

# 6. Check order status
curl http://localhost:8080/api/orders/1

# 7. View statistics
curl http://localhost:8080/api/orders/stats
```

For more comprehensive examples, see the [Examples Documentation](EXAMPLES.md).

## Error Handling

### Standard Error Format

All errors return a JSON object with an `error` field:

```json
{
  "error": "descriptive error message"
}
```

### Common Errors

**400 Bad Request:**
```json
{
  "error": "invalid request body"
}
```

**404 Not Found:**
```json
{
  "error": "order not found"
}
```

**500 Internal Server Error:**
```json
{
  "error": "failed to create order: database connection lost"
}
```

### Error Logging

All errors are logged server-side with full context for debugging:

```
[24/10/2025 - 14:30:45] [ERROR] Failed to create order: customer not found (ID: 999)
```

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity

| Operation | Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Enqueue Order | O(1) | Append to priority queue |
| Dequeue Order | O(1) | Remove from queue front |
| Get Order by ID | O(1) memory / O(log n) database | Direct lookup / indexed query |
| List Orders | O(n) | Must scan all orders |
| Order Statistics | O(n) | Count aggregation |

### Throughput

**In-Memory Mode:**
- Millions of orders/second (CPU-limited)
- Sub-millisecond response times

**Database Mode:**
- 10k-100k orders/second (database-limited)
- Single-digit millisecond response times
- Connection pooling: 100 max connections

### Database Optimizations

- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Connection pooling for concurrency
- Parameterized queries for security
- Transaction support for consistency

---

## Monitoring

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

### Metrics Endpoints

Currently, no dedicated metrics endpoints are exposed.

**Future Enhancement:** Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`:
- Request count by endpoint
- Response time histograms
- Error rates
- Queue size
- Active cook count

---

## Logging

All API operations are logged to daily rotating files:

**Log Location:** `./logs/orders-[dd-mm-yyyy].log`

**Log Format:** `[dd/mm/yyyy - HH:MM:SS] [LEVEL] message`

**Example Logs:**
```
[24/10/2025 - 14:30:45] [INFO] Order 1 created by customer VIP Customer 1 (VIP Customer) - Queue size: 1
[24/10/2025 - 14:30:46] [INFO] Order 1 accepted by cook Cook Bot 1 (ID: 5) - Queue size: 0
[24/10/2025 - 14:30:56] [INFO] Order 1 completed by cook 5
```

---

## Versioning

**Current Version:** v1

**Food API:** Uses explicit versioning (`/api/v1/foods`)

**Other APIs:** No explicit version prefix (considered v1)

**Future:** New versions will use `/api/v2/` prefix to maintain backward compatibility.

---

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation

All inputs are validated at the HTTP layer:
- Type checking (integers, strings, arrays)
- Required field validation
- Format validation

### SQL Injection Prevention

All database queries use parameterized statements:
```go
db.Query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = $1", orderID)
```

### Sensitive Data

- No credentials in code
- Environment variables for configuration
- `.env` files excluded from version control
- Database passwords secured

### Future Enhancements

- JWT authentication
- API key management
- Request signing
- Input sanitization improvements

---

## Client Libraries

Currently, no official client libraries are provided. The API is accessible via standard HTTP clients.

**Examples:**
- JavaScript: `fetch()`, `axios`
- Python: `requests`, `httpx`
- Go: `net/http`, `resty`
- cURL: Command-line HTTP client

See the [Examples Documentation](EXAMPLES.md) for integration examples in multiple languages.
